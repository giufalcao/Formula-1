# Local Code Execution Folder for Spark Only

This folder contains local code intended to be executed in a local Spark environment. If you are using Databricks or another managed Spark environment, you can ignore this folder as it is meant for local development and testing purposes.

## Local Configurations

Make sure to adjust local configurations, such as file paths and connection parameters, as needed for your local environment. This code may not automatically reflect specific settings of the production environment.

## Ignoring the Folder

If you are using Databricks or another managed environment, you can safely ignore this folder. Managed environments usually handle specific settings, such as Warehouse configuration, automatically. Refer to notebooks prefixed with `databricks__`.
